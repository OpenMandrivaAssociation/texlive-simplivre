%description
This package provides a LaTeX class for typesetting books with a simple
and clear design. Currently, it has native support for Chinese
(simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Italian,
Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish
typesetting. It compiles with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. This is part
of the minimalist class series and depends on minimalist.sty from the
minimalist package. The package name "simplivre" is taken from the
French words "simple" and "livre" (= "book").
